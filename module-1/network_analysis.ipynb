        "## Overview\n",
        "This notebook implements Dynamic Risk Assessment methodology to identify and visualize risk networks with special focus on:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **\"Must Go Right\" Risks (Green Arrows)**: Critical risks that act as protective barriers or foundational elements. When these succeed/remain stable, they prevent other risks from being triggered.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **\"Can't Go Wrong\" Risks (Red Arrows)**: High-impact risks that should be avoided at all costs, as their failure would trigger cascading effects throughout the risk network.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Methodology\n",
        "The analysis uses network theory, centrality measures, and impact propagation modeling to classify risks based on:\n",
        "1. **Likelihood** - Probability of occurrence\n",
        "2. **Impact** - Severity of consequences  \n",
        "3. **Velocity** - Speed of impact propagation\n",
        "4. **Connectivity** - How risks interconnect and trigger contagion effects\n"

        "\n",
        "### How to Use This DRA Network Analysis Tool\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Define Your Risk Network**: \n",
        "   - Use `dra_network.add_risk()` to add risks with likelihood, impact, and velocity scores\n",
        "   - Use `dra_network.add_risk_relationship()` to define how risks influence each other\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Run Analysis**:\n",
        "   - The system automatically classifies risks as \"Must Go Right\", \"Can't Go Wrong\", \"High Priority\", or \"Standard\"\n",
        "   - View the network visualization to see risk relationships and classifications\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Interpret Results**:\n",
        "   - **Green nodes (Must Go Right)**: Critical protective barriers that prevent other risks\n",
        "   - **Red nodes (Can't Go Wrong)**: High-impact risks that trigger cascading failures\n",
        "   - **Orange nodes (High Priority)**: Important risks requiring attention\n",
        "   - **Blue nodes (Standard)**: Regular risks with moderate impact\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Features\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Network Visualization**: Interactive graph showing risk relationships\n",
        "- **Risk Classification**: Automated identification of critical risk types\n",
        "- **Centrality Analysis**: Measures of risk importance and connectivity\n",
        "- **Impact Propagation**: Modeling of how risks cascade through the network\n",
        "- **Interactive Dashboard**: Comprehensive analysis with multiple visualizations\n",
        "\n",
        "### Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "To customize this analysis for your specific organization:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Replace the sample risks with your actual risk inventory\n",
        "2. Adjust the classification thresholds based on your risk appetite\n",
        "3. Add industry-specific risk categories and relationships\n",
        "4. Integrate with your existing risk management systems\n",
        "\n",
        "This tool provides a foundation for implementing KPMG's Dynamic Risk Assessment methodology in your organization.\n"
