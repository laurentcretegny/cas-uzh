We can summarize this approach presenting an example by a work of Arya
et al. (2004) in which he states, among other things, that the dynamics of a
balance sheet representation can be modeled through an ane transformation.
Let's consider a balance sheet that has all its accounting items at zero at
the beginning of the period and then is subjected to the following transactions.
Equipment is purchased for $80, let the depreciation expense be $20, the stock
is sold for $100, and cash revenue is $30.
The Balance sheet at the end of the period will be the following:
Assets
Cash
Equipment

50
80

Assets

130

Liabilities
Acc. Depreciation
Capital Stock
Income
Liabilities + Equity

20
100
10
130

We are in an accounting situation that can be modeled as follows. We can
dene a Balance sheet vector with the above accounting items, each one having
value 0 at the beginning of the period

[Cash0 , Equipment0 , Acc. Depreciation0 , Capital Stock0 ] =

[0,

0,

0,

0 ]

−
→

and we can dene a vector of transactions C1 (expressing the transactions
taking place from the time step 0 to the time step 1) with values as above
(equipment purchased for $80, depreciation expense of $20, stock sold for $100,
cash revenue of $30) namely

−
→ 
C1 = ca1 ,

cb1 ,

cc1 ,

cd1



80,

20,

100,

30

So at the end of the accounting period the Balance sheet vector will be:

= −80 + 10 + 30 = 50
Equipment1 = (Cash0 + ca1 ) = (0 + ca1 ) = 80
Acc. Depreciation1 = (Equipment0 + cb1 ) = (0 + cb1 ) = 20
Capital Stock1 = (Acc. Depreciation0 + cc1 ) = (0 + cc1 ) = 100
