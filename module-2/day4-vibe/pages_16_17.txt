account as a left-hand side (LHS) or debit-balance account or as a right-hand
side (RHS) or credit-balance account. Now in general debiting any x to an
account means adding the debit T-term [x // 0] to the T-account, while crediting
x to an account means adding the credit T-term [0 // x] to the T-account.
It is a common mistake of non-accountants to think that debit means negative. But it all depends if the account is a LHS account or a RHS account, which,
as in our case, can be easily assessed looking at the balance sheet equation. As
a matter of fact to debit an account does not necessarily mean to subtract from
the balance in the account, that is only true for credit-balance accounts, debiting
a debit-balance account, like in our case Assets, means adding to the account's
balance.
The second feature of the double entry bookkeeping system, the fact that the
zero-term representation of the balance sheet equilibrium equation, gives a quick
check of the plausibility of the transaction, for each transaction, is even more
important. It remains very useful today in the everyday accounting practice,
and it was denitely more so in a period when there were no computers or
electronic calculators especially in relation to the recording of a high number of
transactions.
Of course this checking opportunity would be present in any kind of transaction recording method that would be based on updating a complete accounting
equation, since the double entry system is a system of recording transactions,
but its feature relating to the zero-term encoding of equations makes it immediate after some practice. For example if, in relation to the above balance sheet,
an event was formulated as the transaction of adding 200 $ to both Liabilities
and NetWorth, some thought would be required to see that this formulation of
a business event could not possibly be correct and much more would be required
for a multiple entry transaction in an accounting system with a lot of accounts.
Yet the check is immediate in the double entry system, Liabilities and NetWorth
are both credit-balance accounts so the proposed transaction is a double credit
transaction in violation of the double entry principle.

3 From the double entry bookkeeping system to
a linear algebra modelization of the balance
sheet dynamics
So far we have seen the characteristics of the double entry bookkeeping system
mathematical framework, now let's approach the linear algebra modelization of
the balance sheet dynamics and establish how the features previously discussed
can be modied in order to achieve dierent goals.

We can summarize this approach presenting an example by a work of Arya
et al. (2004) in which he states, among other things, that the dynamics of a
balance sheet representation can be modeled through an ane transformation.
Let's consider a balance sheet that has all its accounting items at zero at
the beginning of the period and then is subjected to the following transactions.
Equipment is purchased for $80, let the depreciation expense be $20, the stock
is sold for $100, and cash revenue is $30.
The Balance sheet at the end of the period will be the following:
Assets
Cash
Equipment

50
80

Assets

130

Liabilities
Acc. Depreciation
Capital Stock
Income
Liabilities + Equity

20
100
10
130

We are in an accounting situation that can be modeled as follows. We can
dene a Balance sheet vector with the above accounting items, each one having
value 0 at the beginning of the period

[Cash0 , Equipment0 , Acc. Depreciation0 , Capital Stock0 ] =

[0,

0,

0,

0 ]

−
→

and we can dene a vector of transactions C1 (expressing the transactions
taking place from the time step 0 to the time step 1) with values as above
(equipment purchased for $80, depreciation expense of $20, stock sold for $100,
cash revenue of $30) namely

−
→ 
C1 = ca1 ,

cb1 ,

cc1 ,

cd1

80,

So at the end of the accounting period the Balance sheet vector will be:

= −80 + 10 + 30 = 50
Equipment1 = (Cash0 + ca1 ) = (0 + ca1 ) = 80
Acc. Depreciation1 = (Equipment0 + cb1 ) = (0 + cb1 ) = 20
Capital Stock1 = (Acc. Depreciation0 + cc1 ) = (0 + cc1 ) = 100
